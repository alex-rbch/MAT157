# MAT157
TEX'ed lecture notes, assignements, and term tests for MAT157Y5 - Analysis I (2021-2022) at the U of T. 

**Note:** Several of the latest lectures were not TEX'ed. They will be updated later. (Haha, nope.)

These notes were taken during lectures and posted after a short review. 
These are personal lecture notes and, as such, may contain typos and minor errors.
