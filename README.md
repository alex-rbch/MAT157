# MAT157
TEX'ed lecture notes for MAT157Y5 - Analysis I (2021-2022) at the U of T. 

These notes were taken during lectures and posted after a short review. 
Note that these are personal lecture notes and, as such, may contain typos and mistakes.

In December, I will compile them into a single pdf with chapters and proper formatting.
