# MAT157
TEX'ed lecture notes, assignements, and term tests for MAT157Y5 - Analysis I (2021-2022) at the U of T. 

**Note:** Several of the latest lectures were not TEX'ed. They will be updated later.

These notes were taken during lectures and posted after a short review. 
These are personal lecture notes and, as such, may contain typos and minor errors.

In December, I will compile all notes into a single pdf with chapters and proper formatting.
