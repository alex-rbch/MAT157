# MAT157
TEX'ed lecture notes, assignements, and term tests for MAT157Y5 - Analysis I (2021-2022) at the U of T. 

These notes were taken during lectures and posted after a short review. 
Note that these are personal lecture notes and, as such, may contain typos and mistakes.

Several of the latest lectures were not TEX'ed. They will be updated later.

In December, I will compile all notes into a single pdf with chapters and proper formatting.
